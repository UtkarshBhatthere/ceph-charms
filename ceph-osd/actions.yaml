pause:
  description: |
    CAUTION - Set the local osd units in the charm to 'out' but does not stop
    the osds.  Unless the osd cluster is set to noout (see below), this removes
    them from the ceph cluster and forces ceph to migrate the PGs to other OSDs
    in the cluster.  See the following.

    http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/add-or-rm-osds/#removing-the-osd
    "Do not let your cluster reach its full ratio when removing an OSD.
    Removing OSDs could cause the cluster to reach or exceed its full ratio."
    Also note that for small clusters you may encounter the corner case where
    some PGs remain stuck in the active+remapped state. Refer to the above link
    on how to resolve this.

    pause-health (on a ceph-mon) unit can be used before pausing a ceph-osd
    unit to stop the cluster rebalancing the data off this ceph-osd unit.
    pause-health sets 'noout' on the cluster such that it will not try to
    rebalance the data accross the remaining units.

    It is up to the user of the charm to determine whether pause-health should
    be used as it depends on whether the osd is being paused for maintenance or
    to remove it from the cluster completely.

    Set the local osd units in the charm to 'in'. Note that the pause option
    does NOT stop the osd processes.
list-disks:

    List disks
    .
    The 'disks' key is populated with block devices that are known by udev,
    are not mounted and not mentioned in 'osd-journal' configuration option.
    .
    The 'blacklist' key is populated with osd-devices in the blacklist stored
    in the local kv store of this specific unit.
    .
    The 'non-pristine' key is populated with block devices that are known by
    udev, are not mounted, not mentioned in 'osd-journal' configuration option
    and are currently not eligible for use because of presence of foreign data.

    Add disk(s) to blacklist. Blacklisted disks will not be

    The current blacklist can be viewed with list-disks action.

    NOTE: This action and blacklist will not have any effect on
    already initialized disks.

        A space-separated list of devices to add to blacklist.

        directory (the latter is supported for ceph >= 0.56.6).

zap-disk:

    Purge disk of all data and signatures for use by Ceph
    .
    This action can be necessary in cases where a Ceph cluster is being
    redeployed as the charm defaults to skipping disks that look like Ceph
    devices in order to preserve data. In order to forcibly redeploy, the
    admin is required to perform this action for each disk to be re-consumed.
    .
    In addition to triggering this action, it is required to pass an additional
    parameter option of `i-really-mean-it` to ensure that the
    administrator is aware that this *will* cause data loss on the specified
    device(s)
  params:
    devices:
