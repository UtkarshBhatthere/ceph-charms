pause:
  description: |
    CAUTION - Set the local osd units in the charm to 'out' but does not stop
    the osds.  Unless the osd cluster is set to noout (see below), this removes
    them from the ceph cluster and forces ceph to migrate the PGs to other OSDs
    in the cluster.  See the following.

    http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/add-or-rm-osds/#removing-the-osd
    "Do not let your cluster reach its full ratio when removing an OSD.
    Removing OSDs could cause the cluster to reach or exceed its full ratio."
    Also note that for small clusters you may encounter the corner case where
    some PGs remain stuck in the active+remapped state. Refer to the above link
    on how to resolve this.

    pause-health (on a ceph-mon) unit can be used before pausing a ceph-osd
    unit to stop the cluster rebalancing the data off this ceph-osd unit.
    pause-health sets 'noout' on the cluster such that it will not try to
    rebalance the data accross the remaining units.

    It is up to the user of the charm to determine whether pause-health should
    be used as it depends on whether the osd is being paused for maintenance or
    to remove it from the cluster completely.
