    type: string
  ceph-osd-replication-count:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
      object it stores within the images rbd pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the images
      rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although it can be changed in ceph by manually configuring
      your ceph cluster).
  ceph-pool-weight:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Defines a relative weighting of the pool as a percentage of the total
      amount of data in the Ceph cluster. This effectively weights the number
      of placement groups for the pool created to be appropriately portioned
      to the amount of data expected. For example, if the compute images
      for the OpenStack compute instances are expected to take up 20% of the
      overall configuration then this value would be specified as 20. Note -
      it is important to choose an appropriate value for the pool weight as
      this directly affects the number of placement groups which will be
      created for the pool. The number of placement groups for a pool can
      only be increased, never decreased - so it is important to identify the
      percent of data that will likely reside in the pool.
  rbd-pool-name:
    default:
    type: string
    description: |
      Optionally specify an existing pool that shares should map to. Defaults
      to the application's name.
