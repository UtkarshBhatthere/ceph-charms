This charm deploys a Ceph cluster.  It is currently deliberately
inflexible and potentially destructive.  It is designed to deploy on
exactly three machines.  Each machine will run mon and osd.  cephx is
not enabled and sufficient keys are not yet deployed for it to be
enbled after the fact.

We use new-style Ceph deployment, as reverse-engineered from the Chef
cookbook at https://github.com/ceph/ceph-cookbooks, although we
selected a different strategy to form the monitor cluster.  Since we
don't know the names *or* addresses of the machines in advance, we use
the relation-joined hook to wait for all three nodes to come up, and
then write their addresses to ceph.conf in the "mon host" parameter.
After we initialize the monitor cluster a quorum forms quickly, and
OSD bringup proceeds.

See http://ceph.com/docs/master/dev/mon-bootstrap/ for more
information on Ceph monitor cluster deployment strategies and
pitfalls.

The osds use so-called "OSD hotplugging".  ceph-disk-prepare is used
to create the filesystems with a special GPT partition type.  upstart
is set up to mount such filesystems and start the osd daemons as their
storage becomes visible to the system (or after "udevadm trigger").
